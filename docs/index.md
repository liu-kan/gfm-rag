# GFM-RAG Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for GFM-RAG project.

## Overview

The GFM-RAG is the first graph foundation model-powered RAG pipeline that combines the power of graph neural networks to reason over knowledge graphs and retrieve relevant documents for question answering.

We first build a knowledge graph index (KG-index) from the documents to capture the relationships between knowledge. Then, we feed the query and constructed KG-index into the pre-trained graph foundation model (GFM) retriever to obtain relevant documents for LLM generation. The GFM retriever experiences large-scale training and can be directly applied to unseen datasets without fine-tuning.
